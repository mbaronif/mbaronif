- 👋 Hi, I’m @mbaronif
- 👀 I’m interested in languages, books, movies and board games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java Script, Python and Japanese 😁
- 💞️ I’m looking for projects where I can collaborate with translation and writing, besides JS/Python projects where a newbie could contribute and grow
- 📫 You can reach me here or by e-mail: mabaronif@gmail.com

(Still learning, so thanks for the patience 😄)
